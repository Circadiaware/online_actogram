# online_actogram
Script to generate an 'online actogram' from google chrome or safari history files

Currently set to import Safari's History.db file AND chrome's History file. Will need to edit lines 24 or 25 to only attempt to import one or the other. Copy your history files into the same working directory, hit run and you're off to the races!
