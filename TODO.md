# TODO

* [x] pyInstaller
* [x] add screenshot in README
* [x] https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/browserexport or https://github.com/browser-history/browser-history
* [ ] add some text in figure to explain what it is for neophytes and how to read it
* [ ] add autodetection of most common sleep patterns / circadian rhythm disorders patterns (DSPD/night shift work, non-24, ASPD, eveving owl, morning lark, social jet lag). Difference between night shift work and DSPD: night shift work don't sleep as well or as long as DSPD during the day, because not their circadian phase.
